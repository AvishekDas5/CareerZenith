## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Job Recommendation Algorithm

  let score = 0;
  
  // Exact skill matches (weighted heavily)
  user.skills.forEach(skill => {
    if (job.requiredSkills.includes(skill)) {
      score += 25;
    }
  });
  
  // Location preference match
  if (job.location === user.preferredLocation || 
      (user.remotePreference && job.remote)) {
    score += 15;
  }
  
  // Experience level match
  if (Math.abs(job.experienceYears - user.experienceYears)  {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(0);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Animate progress bar on mount
    setTimeout(() => {
      setWidth(level * 20); // Convert level (1-5) to percentage
    }, 300);
  }, []);
  
  return (
    
      {skill}
